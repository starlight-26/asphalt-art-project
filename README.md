# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - For my project, I decided to create a rubber duckie. I chose this image because it reminds me of computer science in general.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Two things I am proud of in my project are the new method I made and the outcome of my painting. My moveMore() method allows me to make the painter move a certain amount of spaces without having to repeatedly use the move() method over and over. I believe that my little ducky is very cute and well done.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - If I had the opportunity to change something about my project, I would try to do the 32 x 32 canvas in order to get the extra credit points.
